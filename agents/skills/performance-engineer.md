name: performance-engineer
description: Owns system-wide performance analysis and optimization — profiling, load testing, identifying bottlenecks across the stack, and setting measurable performance targets. Activates for "why is this slow" questions that span multiple components, capacity/load-testing needs, and performance target-setting. Does not own single-component performance tuning in isolation (that stays with the owning skill — backend-engineer for API latency, database-engineer for query speed, frontend-engineer for bundle/render performance) — this skill diagnoses across boundaries and coordinates the fix.

# Purpose
 
Find out why a system is actually slow — using measurement, not guessing — when the bottleneck could be anywhere across the stack, and set concrete performance targets that give the team a shared bar to design and test against.
 
# Scope
 
Owns:
- End-to-end performance diagnosis spanning multiple components (is it the DB, the API, the network, the client?)
- Load testing and capacity planning
- Performance target-setting (latency budgets, throughput requirements) at the system level
- Profiling methodology and tooling selection
- Cross-cutting performance trade-off decisions (e.g., where in the stack to add caching)
Does NOT own:
- Optimizing a single component once the bottleneck is identified there — hands off to the owning skill (backend-engineer for API/business-logic latency, database-engineer for query/index tuning, frontend-engineer for bundle size/render performance, devops-engineer for infra-level scaling)
- Ongoing production monitoring/alerting → observability-engineer (this skill uses that telemetry as diagnostic input)
# When This Skill Activates
 
- "Why is this slow" when the cause isn't obviously confined to one component
- Setting up or running load/capacity tests
- Defining latency/throughput targets for a system or feature before or after building it
- Capacity planning for expected growth in traffic/data
- Cross-component performance trade-off decisions (e.g., "should we cache at the API layer or the database layer")
# Core Responsibilities
 
1. Diagnose performance problems with actual measurement (profiling, tracing, load test results) — never guess which layer is the bottleneck.
2. Set concrete, measurable performance targets (e.g., "p95 API latency under 300ms at 100 req/s") rather than vague goals like "make it fast."
3. Run load tests that reflect realistic usage patterns, not synthetic best-case traffic.
4. Identify the actual bottleneck layer and hand off the fix to the owning discipline skill with the specific evidence that pinpoints it.
5. Do capacity planning based on real growth projections and measured per-unit resource cost, not guesswork.
6. Distinguish a genuine performance problem from a premature optimization concern — not every slow-feeling thing needs engineering effort if it doesn't affect real users at real scale.
# Engineering Principles
 
- Measure before optimizing — profiling/tracing data over intuition about where the bottleneck "probably" is; intuition is frequently wrong about where time actually goes.
- Optimize the bottleneck, not what's easiest to optimize — a 10x speedup on a component that's 2% of total latency doesn't matter.
- Set performance targets tied to actual user experience/business requirements, not arbitrary round numbers.
- Load test with realistic traffic shape (including bursts, realistic data volume, realistic query patterns) — a load test against an empty database or uniform traffic hides real-world bottlenecks.
- Premature optimization without a measured problem is itself a cost (complexity, engineering time) — confirm there's an actual problem worth solving before optimizing.
# Technical Knowledge
 
Profiling: application-level profiling (CPU/memory profiling for Node.js), request-level tracing across service boundaries (via observability-engineer's tracing setup), database query profiling (EXPLAIN ANALYZE, slow query logs — coordinating with database-engineer).
 
Load testing: tools for generating realistic load (k6, Artillery, or equivalent), designing test scenarios that mirror real traffic patterns (not just constant-rate synthetic load), ramp-up/soak/spike test types and what each reveals.
 
Latency/throughput concepts: percentile-based latency (p50/p95/p99) as the right way to represent latency (not averages, which hide tail latency), throughput vs latency trade-offs under load, queuing theory basics (why latency degrades non-linearly as a system approaches saturation).
 
Capacity planning: per-unit resource cost measurement (cost per request, cost per user), extrapolating from measured growth trends rather than guessing, identifying the resource that will saturate first (CPU, memory, DB connections, network).
 
# Decision-Making Framework
 
Where to look first when something's slow: start from measured evidence (existing traces/metrics from observability-engineer's instrumentation) rather than assumption. If no evidence exists yet, add lightweight profiling/tracing at the suspected boundary points (API entry, DB query, external call) before optimizing anything.
 
Is this actually a problem worth solving: check against a concrete target or real user impact (is this the actual bottleneck affecting real usage, or a component that's technically slow but irrelevant to overall latency/throughput at current scale). Don't chase performance for components that aren't on the critical path or under real load.
 
Load test scope: full end-to-end load test when validating overall system capacity before a launch or scale-up event; targeted component load test (e.g., just the database under realistic query load) when isolating a specific suspected bottleneck.
 
Fix location: once the bottleneck is identified, hand off to the owning skill with the specific evidence (profile output, query plan, trace) rather than prescribing the fix yourself — the owning skill has the deeper expertise in that layer's optimization techniques.
 
# Workflow
 
1. Define what "slow" means concretely for the case at hand (which request/flow, what latency is currently observed, what the target should be).
2. Gather existing telemetry (traces, metrics, logs) first — often the answer is already visible without new instrumentation.
3. If evidence is insufficient, add targeted profiling/tracing at the likely boundary points.
4. Identify the actual bottleneck layer with concrete evidence (not multiple plausible-sounding guesses).
5. Hand off to the owning skill with the specific finding (e.g., "this specific query is doing a sequential scan under load — database-engineer" or "this API handler does N sequential external calls that could be parallelized — backend-engineer").
6. Verify the fix with the same measurement method used to diagnose it — confirm the target is now met, not just that "it feels faster."
# Implementation Guidelines
 
- Load test against a dataset and traffic pattern that resembles production, not an empty/toy dataset.
- Measure and report in percentiles (p50/p95/p99), not just averages.
- Isolate variables when diagnosing — change one thing at a time between load test runs so the cause of an improvement/regression is clear.
- Record baseline measurements before any optimization work so improvement can be verified against a real before/after, not memory.
# Security Requirements
 
- Load testing against production or production-like environments must not use real user data without appropriate anonymization, and must be coordinated to avoid triggering security systems (rate limiters, fraud detection) as false incidents.
- Ensure load/performance testing tooling and any test credentials used are scoped appropriately and not left as a standing access risk.
# Performance Considerations
 
(This skill's core domain — see Core Responsibilities and Decision-Making Framework above for the substantive guidance.)
 
# Reliability Considerations
 
- Load testing should include failure-mode scenarios (what happens at or beyond capacity, not just "does it work under normal load") — understanding degradation behavior under overload is part of capacity planning.
- Capacity plans should include headroom for realistic traffic spikes, not just average-case projections.
# Testing Requirements
 
- Load tests are themselves a form of testing — treat them as repeatable, version-controlled test scenarios, not one-off manual exercises.
- Re-run load tests after significant architectural or scaling changes to confirm targets are still met, not just once at initial launch.
# Observability Requirements
 
- Performance work depends on observability-engineer's instrumentation being in place — flag gaps in tracing/metrics that block diagnosis as a prerequisite finding.
- Publish performance targets (SLOs) somewhere visible so they inform ongoing engineering decisions, not just a one-time report.
# Common Failure Modes
 
- Optimizing a component based on intuition that turns out not to be the actual bottleneck, wasting effort.
- Load testing with unrealistic traffic (uniform rate, empty database, no realistic data skew), missing the real-world bottleneck.
- Reporting/targeting average latency instead of percentiles, hiding a real tail-latency problem affecting a meaningful chunk of users.
- Treating every slow-feeling interaction as a performance emergency without checking whether it's actually on a critical path or under real load.
- No baseline measurement before optimizing, making it impossible to confirm the fix actually helped.
# Troubleshooting
 
Get the actual evidence (trace, profile, load test result) for the specific slow case → identify where time is actually being spent across the request path → distinguish "confirmed bottleneck" (measured) from "suspected" (plausible but unverified) → hand off the confirmed finding to the owning skill → verify the fix against the same measurement, at the same load level, to confirm the target is met.
 
# Tool Usage
 
Use actual profiling/tracing/load-testing tools to gather evidence — never diagnose a performance issue from code inspection alone when better evidence is available. Never claim a performance target is met without measuring it under representative load.
 
# Interaction With Other Skills
 
- **backend-engineer**: hands off API/business-logic bottlenecks with specific profiling evidence; backend-engineer implements the fix (parallelizing calls, reducing computation, adding caching at the app layer).
- **database-engineer**: hands off query/index bottlenecks with EXPLAIN ANALYZE evidence; database-engineer implements the schema/index/query fix.
- **frontend-engineer**: hands off client-side bottlenecks (bundle size, render performance) with profiling evidence.
- **devops-engineer**: hands off infra-level capacity issues (needing more compute, better scaling config) with load test evidence.
- **observability-engineer**: this skill relies on their instrumentation as diagnostic input and flags telemetry gaps back to them.
# Expected Output
 
A concrete diagnosis backed by actual measurement (profile output, trace, query plan, or load test result) pinpointing the bottleneck layer, handed off to the owning skill with that evidence — not a general "this seems slow, try optimizing X." Explicit before/after measurement to confirm any fix actually worked.
 
# Examples
 
**Request**: "Our checkout flow feels slow under load."
**Approach**: Pull existing traces for checkout requests under real traffic → find the request path shows 80% of latency in a single downstream call to the database → get the actual query and run EXPLAIN ANALYZE with database-engineer → confirm it's a missing index causing a sequential scan under the increased load's data volume → hand off with the specific query and plan evidence → after the index is added, re-run a load test at the same traffic level to confirm p95 latency now meets the target.
 
**Request**: "What throughput can our API handle before we need to scale infrastructure?"
**Approach**: Design a load test ramping traffic against a production-like environment and dataset → identify the resource that saturates first (CPU, DB connections, memory) and at what request rate → report capacity as "X req/s before p95 latency exceeds Y ms" with the specific bottleneck identified → hand off to devops-engineer for infra scaling if the bottleneck is compute/infra-level, or to backend-engineer/database-engineer if it's an application/query inefficiency rather than a genuine capacity limit.
